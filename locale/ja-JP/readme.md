# Introduction
This document describes the features of Elten - the client of the EltenLink portal for Windows, which is used by blind people to communicate. The program allows you to send private and group messages, discuss in text and voice forums, write blogs with the possibility to create audio posts, create voice calls and much more.
## Basic keyboard
You navigate through the app primarily using the alt key, arrow keys, and tab key, just as you would in Windows. The alt key opens the main menu, which you navigate with the left-right arrows, expand with the down arrow or enter, and select the option you want with the enter key.
In many places in the program, we can also use the context menu, which often gives us access to actions specific to a given element. The context menu can be opened by pressing the context menu key or by default with the shift+f10 shortcut, but it may also be the first item in the main menu when the alt key is pressed, if this has been set in the settings.
Where you play media, the spacebar stops playback, the left/right arrows scroll, and the up/down arrows change the volume.
Pressing F1 (the default) reads all the additional keyboard shortcuts of the currently selected control.
## Quick Actions
On the main screen of the application we also have access to so called quick actions, which allow us to easily get to any place in the program. Quick actions can be assigned to keyboard shortcuts, as well as hidden or deleted.
You can also add to quick actions any group, conversation, the most interesting blog and so on.
Note: If you remove any item from quick actions, you will also remove its shortcut. To leave the shortcut, instead of deleting it, select hide this action.
## Add-on for nvda
If you are using nvda, Elten will ask you to install an add-on. It improves Elten's interaction with NVDA, allows text scrolling or braille support, and allows you to use the same shortcuts you use in NVDA, such as Insert+A to read text.

# Community
The Community menu contains functions for communication between Elten users, the most important of which are messages, voice conferencing, blogs and a forum.
## Messages
In the Messages section you can send voice and text messages. In addition, the program allows you to create a group conversation for a group of friends.
By default, recorded voice messages can be no longer than 2 minutes.
After buying the audiophile package this limit is lifted.
You can also send attachments in your messages (up to 4 MB by default). After subscribing to the courier package, this limit is increased to 32 MB and you will be able to add polls to your messages.
This section also allows you to receive and send e-mails, it gives us some interesting possibilities, for example you can easily use mailing lists, register accounts in different services with your Elten e-mail address and most of all - you can easily e-mail other people.
Each user has his own e-mail address, which consists of a user name and the domain Elten.me, e.g. john@Elten.me.
To create an e-mail message, go to the Messages section, select create new message, then in the Recipient field, enter the e-mail address of the person to whom you want to send the message.
## Blogs
Blogs are one of the most used functions of Elten. They make it very easy to create and manage blogs and to view and comment on the work of others.
Currently there are hundreds of blogs on Elten, with a variety of content ranging from cooking, gaming, philosophy, fiction, and differential equations. You can find just about anything here, and it's up to you what you choose. 
This feature lets you create both text and audio content.
You can browse blogs by the following categories:
Managed blogs - our own blogs,
Recently updated blogs - a list of blogs in chronological order; blogs with the most recent posts are at the top. If you are planning to run a blog, regular posting will definitely affect its popularity,
Frequently updated - the name speaks for itself,
Followed blogs - blogs that we follow; we get notifications whenever a new post is posted.
Elten also allows us to view those blogs that are popular among the users we have added to our contacts.
Moreover, after subscribing to the Scribe package, it is possible to follow specific posts, thanks to which we will receive information each time a new comment is posted on them.
This is done using the Followed posts category.
### Creating your own blog
Each user can create one blog in the free version, and once you have purchased the "scribe" package, you have the chance to create an unlimited number of unique blogs, including blogs shared with other users.
The blogs run on the wordpress system, so you can use many of the plugins available in this system. In addition, thanks to this we have access to a large number of features that allow us to take care of the appearance of our blog.
If you are worried that you cannot share your blog with your friends outside Elten, nothing simpler - just copy the link to your blog or to a particular post and send it to any person or share it e.g. on Facebook.
To create your own blog, simply go to Managed Blogs, then use the CTRL+N shortcut, enter a name and press enter.
After pressing enter on a newly created blog, you may use the CTRL+N shortcut to add new categories or, after entering a given category or All Posts, to add new posts.
When creating a new post, we can choose options such as the type of editor, the visibility of the post - for all or only for our friends, and we can allow or disallow commenting on it.
We can also add tags to an post by pressing the familiar CTRL+N shortcut on the tags section under the tab.
### Customising your blog
If you press CTRL+E on one of your managed blogs or select the relevant option from the context menu, you will be shown the options for that blog.
In the General section, we can set such things as its name, description, language or mark it as public.
Public blogs are searchable in search engines such as Google and others, unchecking this box should, although not in every case, prohibit search engines from showing this blog in search results.
In the Comments section, we can set who can comment on our posts and whether comments need to be approved, and enable automatic blocking of comments after a certain time.
We can also set how comments should be sorted on the site.
In the Posts section, there are various options for personalising the display of your posts in the browser.
In the Date and Time section, we can set the format and time zone of the blog.
In the Other section we can manage our wordpress account, blog tags and its domain. Here we can also find pending comments for approval.
### Viewing external wordpress blogs
This is a powerful feature, making it much easier to browse blogs running on wordpress. When you open a blog, Elten can display posts from all categories on that blog, but it is also possible to browse individual categories. This way, no time is wasted on graphics and ads present on the page are skipped.
To check if a blog is supported, enter its URL under "open external wordpress blog".
## Forum
Forum is a place where you can talk about various topics. To make it easier to find interesting content, it has been divided into groups.
Additionally, at the bottom of the forum you will find such tabs as Recently Active Groups, Recommended Groups, Open Groups or All Groups.
Each user can create their own groups.
#### Recommended groups
These are the most popular groups on Elten, they are the backbone of the forum. 
#### Public groups
These are groups which usually deal with more specific topics. If you have a passion, if you know more about a topic than anyone else or if you just want to see what it is like to manage a group, there is nothing to stop you from creating a group.
It is worth noting that even if someone does not belong to a public group, they can still browse its forums.
The group administrator can determine whether anyone can join the group or whether a request to join must be approved by the administrator or moderators.
A public group has a chance of becoming recommended if it proves interesting enough for a large part of the community.
#### Hidden groups
This type of group can only be joined by an invitation from an administrator or moderator. The group is not publicly visible and uninvited people cannot browse its forums. This group can be used to discuss more sensitive topics or simply to chat with friends.
### Keyboard Shortcuts
To help you search for content in the forum, the most important shortcuts are listed below:
CTRL+, (comma) - go to the first post in the thread,
CTRL+. (dot) - go to the last post in the thread,
CTRL+u - go to the first unread post in the thread,
Shift+Enter - show all threads in a group
Shift+Left/Right arrows - allow you to set what you want to read first when navigating groups, forums or threads. For example, you can set Elten to inform you before the name of each group about the number of unread posts, and then the name of the group you are on.
Shift +Up/Down arrow - allows you to browse the threads in a given group by tags. Tags are a set of keywords that make it easier to quickly find the right thread, for example, some threads may be tagged "closed" or "resolved". If you select the "resolved" tag, navigating with the up and down arrows alone, you will only come across threads which are tagged with this tag.
### Useful features in the forum
To make it easier to browse content, we can follow forums or threads that interest us. To do this, you must, while standing with the cursor on a given section in a group, enter the context menu and add the forum you are interested in to the followed forums, and if you want to follow a thread, then, while standing on the thread, enter the context menu and select Add to followed threads.
Please note that in order to monitor entire forums in groups of which we are not moderators or administrators, we must have purchased the Courier package.
In addition, we may mark a thread which we have not read, e.g. because it has several hundred posts, for reading later; to do this, use the arrows to find the appropriate thread, and then select Mark thread from the context menu. Instead of entering the context menu, we can simply press CTRL+H.
The list of marked threads can be found at the top of the forum, in the Marked Threads tab.
Please note that marking threads is only possible after purchasing the Elten premium courier package.
If you don't have time to finish reading a thread, you can use bookmarks; to do this, on the post you've finished reading, go to the context menu, then use enter to select navigation, then bookmarks; on the list that appears, go to the context menu and click New Bookmark.
You can also create a bookmark using the shortcut combination - CTRL+B (to enter bookmarks) and CTRL+N.
Creating bookmarks is possible after buying the Courier package.
The same package allows you to hide signatures of other users. To do this simply use the context menu on any post and use the down arrow to find the Hide signatures option.
### Mentions
Mention messages are short messages with an automatic link to the relevant post. If you see a post which you know your friend may be interested in, you will add a link to this post and, if appropriate, a short note stating why you are referring to this particular post.
After opening the mention, the recipient will be automatically transferred to the relevant post.
After subscribing to the courier package, it is also possible to reply to mentions and view the history of mentions.
## conferences
This module allows you to conduct voice conferences with other users of the program, similar to applications such as teamtalk or discord. It is also possible to watch movies and listen to music together.
Thanks to support for two sound cards, you can also host podcasts or present games. The latter function is only available to users who have subscribed to the audiophile package.
### Create your own channel
Once you've entered the conference, you'll see a list of channels. To join any channel, move the up and down arrows and press enter or CTRL+J on the channel you're interested in, if any are available. To create a new channel, press CTRL+N or select new channel from the context menu.
If you're not an advanced user and just want to chat with your friends, you can safely leave all the default values, just type in the channel name, then tab to find create a channel and press enter. The default settings are more than sufficient for this.
Channel name - this is where you enter the name under which your room will be visible.
Language - select the language in which the conversations on the channel will take place. It is possible to filter channels by language.
Bitrate - the higher the bitrate, the better the quality, but also the higher the data consumption; increasing the bitrate is not recommended for weak internet connections.
Frame size - the larger the frame, the better the quality and lower data consumption, but higher latency.
Channels - here we can choose whether our channel is to be stereo or mono.
Space virtualisation - with the panning setting when moving on the channel board, the users position will only change from left to right, and with the hrtf setting we will be able to walk in 3d, i.e. when moving we will be able to hear the callers from the left, right, front and back (see below).
Note: premium users who have purchased the audiophile package will be able to select the room size and background sounds for the hrtf channel.
Set password for this channel - if you check this box and enter the password, no one who does not know the password will get into the channel; do not give the password to people you do not want in the channel.
### Channel space
When you create your own channel or join an existing one, the first thing your cursor will stand on is the channel space. 
Let's imagine that our channel is a room with other callers in it. By default, we're all standing in the same place. 
Using the left, right, up and down arrows, we can move around this virtual space.
When we set the virtual space to panning when creating a channel, the left-right arrows move us left or right relative to other users, and the up and down arrows change their volume. The further away we stand from someone, the greater the volume differences are.
When space virtualisation is set to hrtf, we will hear other callers from different directions; if we move away from them, we will hear them more quietly.
### List of channel users.
Press the tab key once to get to the list of channel users. Use the up and down arrows to navigate through the list as usual.
If you open the context menu on a user, you will see options such as changing the volume or muting the user.
It is also possible to whisper to other users, so that other people in the channel will not hear it. To do this, hold down the space bar while speaking to the person you want to whisper to; releasing the space bar means the whisper ends.
Use the CTRL+G shortcut to approach another user, provided they have previously changed their position on the channel board. By pressing this shortcut on yourself, you can find yourself at the start position in the space.
### Chat.
You can also write text messages in the channel. The first field, Chat history, allows us to view recent messages. 
Note that the history for events before you joined the channel is not visible to you. When you leave the channel, the history is not saved.
We can enter our message in the chat field. You can send it by pressing enter.
### objects and streaming
When you press enter on the Objects and streaming option, a menu appears where you have a choice of options:
*Channel objects - if we want to add variety to our conference, we have this option. With objects; we can add forest, mountain or sea sounds.
If you create a large channel, you can place sounds in different places to add variety to the channel space. For example, place a clock in the bottom corner, bar sounds in the middle and city sounds in the top right corner.
*Sound card streaming - with this option, you can stream movies, songs, whatever you want to your channel.
*Stream audio file - if you want to play a file from your computer to your conference participants, you can easily do it with this option; click enter, select the file from your computer and from now on, everyone in the channel can hear what you want to present to them.
### change volume
By pressing enter on the Change Volume option, you can manage the volume of your microphone, the main volume, i.e. how you hear everyone in the conversation, and the volume of the stream.
Use the up and down arrows to adjust the volume, and use the tab to move between volume types.
### Status
Here we can check how much time we have spent on the channel, what latency we have, and how much data we have sent and received. The latter is particularly useful if you have a limited internet package.
To check your latency, turn on the listen on yourself.
### Push To Talk
If you only want to be heard when you hold down the corresponding key, then simply select this option.
If you check the box, you can use the tab key to set which key you want your microphone to activate when you press it. You can choose from shift, alt or CTRL as well as letter and number keys. You can select more than one key.
### Save this conference to file
This function allows you to record what is happening on your channel. If you want to have the recording of the conference in one file, then select save the mix of streams to one file.
There is also an option added experimentally, Keep separate streams, which allows you to save each user from the channel in a separate file.
### Calling other users.
When you don't feel like creating a channel but want to talk to someone, you can call them. To do this, simply select someone from your contact list and choose Call from the context menu.
## Notes
Elten allows you to create your note and share it with other people, for example to edit the text together later.
## Polls
Polls are a simple tool that allows Elten users to see what other users think about various topics. They are also used to find out how Elten members feel about, for example, new features in Elten. Group administrators can use them to get answers to questions relevant to their group.
Polls can be used by anyone and everyone can create them without limitation, and what you ask is up to you.
It's worth noting that polls can also be added to forum posts so that users can access them more easily.
Elten allows you to filter the responses in your polls. For example, let's imagine that someone created a poll about cooking. In the first question he asked if we like to cook. Thanks to the filtering option you can see how the following questions were answered by people who like to cook and those who are not fond of this activity.
To use the filters, select a specific poll and then the Show Results option. Use the up and down arrows to move between questions; when you press tab on a question, you will see the answers below the arrows.
On each answer, after pressing the context menu, two options appear: Filter with this answer and Filter without this answer. If the question has 3 answers and we choose Filter without this answer on the first of the three options, it will not be taken into account. That is, if out of 9 people, 3 voted for hypothetical answers A, B and C, each answer has 33% of the vote; after filtering out answer A, the first one has 0%, the other two have 50%. From now on, people from answer A will not be considered for other questions.
## Users
Here you will find information about the accounts of Elten users.
### Contact list
The people you have added to your contacts can be found here.
### Other options
Further down the menu you can, for example, find out who is currently online, the list of recently registered users on Elten or the most recently active users.
In addition, you will find the Elder Council, which is made up of users who have had a significant impact on Elten's development.
## Manage my account
Here you will find all the settings related to your account.
### Profile
Here you can enter some information about yourself, such as your age or gender, which will be visible in your visitingcard to other users.
### Visitingcard
If you would like to write something about yourself and encourage other users to write to you, this is a good place for it.
### Languages
Elten has various language filters.  This prevents groups, blogs and voice conference channels, for example, from displaying in languages you don't speak.
### Status and signature
Status and signature can be used to enter a short sentence or quote that is important to you.
Status is displayed after our user name in the contact list, for example, whereas a signature is displayed below our forum entries.
### What's new Notifications
Here you can specify what news you would like to be notified of by Elten.
### privacy
You can adjust, for example, who (all Elten users or just your friends) should see your profile. In addition, you can set a setting so that only people you have in your contacts can call you.
### security
This section allows you to change your email address, password or set up two-factor authentication.
Two-factor authentication significantly increases the security of your account. Every time you log on to Elten, you will have to enter your password and a received sms code.
### Other
Under this tab you can purchase premium packages to support the Elten project.

# programs
Programs section contains additional packages to extend Elten's capabilities. We can add and remove them as needed. This section of the document will describe some of them.
## File Manager
This program allows us to browse the disk of our computer. We can use it instead of Windows explorer. You can use it to open audio, .html or text files (including .doc, .txt, .rtf, .pdf - after installing the appropriate package).
It is also possible to convert text files into voice files, read by a synthesizer, after installing the Speech Outputter program.
The manager can be used as a player for many popular audio formats such as mp3, Wave, OGG, Wma, flac or opus.
It is worth noting that thanks to the manager we can open files located e.g. in folders of applications such as Dropbox or Google Drive on the computer.
## Youtube.
With this program we can watch videos from youtube and download them to disk. Files can be automatically converted to popular audio formats. However, it is not possible to read comments under the video, log into your google account or subscribe to channels.
## Playlist
Installing this program allows us to create and manage playlists; after adding the appropriate shortcuts to Quick Actions, we can play them from anywhere in the program.

# Tools
In the tools section we can change the program settings, use functions such as checking the Internet connection or debugger.
## Program settings.
You can navigate through the settings using the up and down arrows to select a category. After selecting the section you are interested in, you can access its settings by pressing the tab.
### General
Language - here you can set the main language of the program interface.
Note that this only applies to the interface, not to group filters or conference channels.
Automatically minimize Elten Window to system tray - Elten will be minimized when you switch to another window. You can restore it later from the tray using CTRL+Alt+Shift+T combination.
Enable auto-login - if this checkbox is selected, Elten will log in automatically every time it starts, without the need for a login or password. It is not recommended to set this option if you are not the only user of the computer.
Automatically start Elten after I log on to Windows - the program starts automatically with Windows.
The next option allows you to check for updates each time you start the program. If a stable version is available, an update will be shown and, if approved, will be downloaded.
Send Elten usage reports - Elten will send basic information such as your computer system and processor to the program developer.
### Interface
First of all, there is a checkbox which allows you to hear the sound of a set sound theme. The next field is responsible for its volume. Then you can select the sound theme itself.
If you press the Tab key again, you will find yourself in the Manage sound themes option, where you can download and delete sound themes. 
Note! By subscribing to the audiophile package, it is possible to download all sound themes available on the Elten server.
The next checkbox is the positioning of the interface sounds in space; when moving through menus or lists, the sound moves from left to right as you move through the items. Unchecking this box causes all interface sounds to be heard in the middle.
The next field allows us to disable or enable background sounds (e.g. in menus) and dialog sounds.
Show context menu in the menu bar - context menu, available under the context menu key or Shift+F10, will additionally be displayed as the first tile of the main menu, under the Alt key.
Announcement about types of controls - here we can choose whether we are to be informed about the type of control by voice, sound, or perhaps by voice and sound. The type of control is for example a checkbox, button, edit field, etc.
Another checkbox specifies whether lines are to be wrapped in text fields
Display method of selection lists - determines whether, when the down arrow reaches the end of the list, the cursor should stop, or, in the circular variant, should move back to the beginning of the list.
Round up the forms - a similar option, but applies to moving the focus around forms; when selected, the focus will move around them.
### Voice.
In this category, we can choose whether Elten should use nvda, as a screen reader, or a sapi 5 synthesizer of our choice. We can also choose the typing echo, which is what Elten should read out to us when we type characters and words.
There is also a checkbox for enabling braille support. Only works with nvda and requires the add-on installed
Note that this feature can cause problems with very long text fields; it is recommended that you disable it if you have problems.
### Clock
By default, Elten informs you of full hours with a sound and a voice. Here you can set whether this should be a sound, a sound together with voice information or no information at all. You can also change the frequency at which you are informed of the current time; you can choose between hourly, half-hourly and 15-minutely notifications.
In addition, we can allow Elten to "wake" us up at a time of our choosing by adding our own alarms.
### Audio devices.
Output device - here we select the sound card through which Elten should send sound.
Microphone - as the name suggests, here we select the sound card through which Elten will record sound, for example in voice conferences, forums or voice messages.
The next checkbox allows you to enable or disable fx effects.
Next, we can choose whether noise reduction should be enabled for conferences, conferences and forums or not at all. Noise reduction is very useful if your computer's fans make a loud noise or your microphone simply hums.
We can also enable/disable echo cancellation. This feature allows you to avoid so-called feedback, commonly known as crossover when headphones are disconnected.
