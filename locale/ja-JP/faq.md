# General
## Who created Elten, who manages it?
Elten was created by David Pieper, pajper on Elten.
Information about the people who administer the portal or parts of it can be found in the menu, 'Community', 'Users', 'Administration and authors'.
In the legal sense, the project is the responsibility of the "Fundacja Prowadnica" ("Prowadnica Foundation"), established by the author and registered in Poland in the Register of associations, other social and professional organisations, foundations and public health service establishments of the National Court Register under number 0000893029, VAT-UE PL5882467405, REGON 388594504.
You can read more about the Foundation on its website (only in poloish) [prowadnica.org](https://prowadnica.org).

## Is there or will there be an Elten for other hardware platforms?
At the moment Elten is only available for Windows. There have been reports of success in running the program using the Wine emulator, but this method is not officially supported and we cannot vouch for the correct functioning of it.
There are plans to develop a mobile version for iOS and Android, but we cannot provide any dates at this time.

## How can I contact the administration or the developer of Elten?
Information about the people who administer the portal or parts of it can be found in the menu, "Community", "Users", "Administration and authors". From here, you can send the relevant users a private message.
You can also contact them in other ways; please have a look at the visitingcards of the respective administrators, where you may find other contacts.
The project administration can also be contacted directly by e-mail at [support@elten.link](mailto:support@elten.link).
The "Prowadnica Foundation", which runs the project, can be contacted at [fundacja@prowadnica.org](mailto:fundacja@prowadnica.org). Please note that we do not provide any technical or other support regarding Elten at this address.

## Where can I report a bug or a proposal?
The best place is the designated forums of the group "Elten Development" (Polish language) or "Elten Development" (English language).
Bypassing these avenues and the beta tester groups, other submissions, especially proposals, will not be acknowledged.

## How do I install sound themes?
Sound themes available in the server repository can be downloaded from the menu, "Tools", "Sound themes", by selecting "Download sound themes" from the context menu.
Elten's sound themes are saved in files with the extension *.elsnd and are located in the "%appdata%\elten\soundthemes" folder, where %appdata% stands for the Roaming folder of the application data.
To get to this folder, the easiest way is to press WINDOWS+R, type "%appdata%" in the "Open" field and press enter.

## How do I create a sound theme?
You can create your own sound theme from the menu, "Tools", "Sound themes", by selecting "New" from the context menu. A list of sounds will be presented, which can be freely edited.
The theme created in this way can be sent to the members of the Elder Council for approval and placement in the server repository, or it can only be used privately or shared through other means.

## Does Elten support screen readers other than NVDA?
Elten does not support other screen readers. However, it is possible to use SAPI5 synthesisers.

## How can the project be supported?
Support for the project can be divided into tangible and intangible.
The forms of financial support are the purchase of premium packages or simply donations destined for the "Prowadnica Foundation".
In addition to money, Elten also needs programmers, translators and testers. If you can code or know a language into which the program is not yet translated and you want to help, feel free to contact the Elder Council.

## How and what to use the invisible interface for?
The Invisible Interface is a feature that allows you to perform key actions from anywhere in Elten or even other applications. For example, it is possible to exchange private messages with other users while browsing the Internet or writing a document in Word.
The Invisible Interface is a series of selectable keyboard shortcuts that will allow you to read information or display a reply window. A list of these shortcuts can be found in the "Help" menu, "Invisible Interface Keyboard Shortcuts", and changed in the "Tools, Program Settings, Invisible Interface" menu.

## How to use braille displays in Elten?
Elten only allows braille displays to be used via the NVDA screen reader. Make sure that a dedicated add-on is installed and then enable the appropriate setting from the "Tools" menu, "Program settings", "Voice".

## Where can I find the file manager, playlist and other features to extend Elten's capabilities?
Options such as the file manager were an integral part of Elten until version 2.4. Since version 2.4, they have been removed from it and made available as "Programs" - plug-ins to extend its functionality.
These can be downloaded from the "Programs" menu, "Install new programs".

## Where can I get information about the Elten betatesting?
Before each release of a stable version of Elten, there is a testing phase in which at least a few dozen beta versions are usually released. These versions contain untested new features. Testers actively evaluate new developments and point out bugs.
It is worth noting that many beta proposals do not pass this verification phase and, under the influence of the testers' evaluation, are completely changed or rejected.
Before installing a beta version, it should be borne in mind that it is untested software in which numerous bugs will be present. It is not recommended that less technical users join the beta test.
Information about the beta tests is published in the Polish and English official forums, where you can also find information about signing up for them.

## How do I create a portable version of Elten?
A portable version can be created from the menu, "Tools", "Create portable version". In the same place, you can decide whether to copy the current settings into the version to be created.
Please note that the portable version cannot be updated.

## Menus versus context menus, what is the difference?
The context menu contains the options associated with the currently selected control. For example, in the list of forums, it will contain the options for the selected forum. The context menu is opened using the applications key and, by default, the SHIFT+F10 shortcut assigned via a quick action. This shortcut can be changed or deleted.
The menu opened with the alt key allows you to open the most important options of the program, such as messages, forums and settings.
If a context menu is available at a given location, its options are also displayed at the beginning of the menu bar by default. This behaviour can be changed from the settings, in the "Interface" section under the option "Display context menu in menu bar".

## How do I update Elten?
By default, Elten checks for the availability of a new version on start-up. If a new version is available, a message will be displayed suggesting an update. This behaviour can be deactivated from the settings, in the "General" section under the option "Check for updates on start-up".
In addition, if a new version of the program is available, this will be displayed under "What's new".
It is also possible to force the installation of the latest version. To do this, use the option available in the menu, "Tools", "Reinstall program". The program will ask which version should be installed. Select the option to install the latest version from the server.

## What does the plug-in for NVDA provide?
A dedicated plug-in for the NVDA reader enables Elten to support braille displays and scroll through text as it is read.
Its use is not required but is highly recommended.

## Where can I find information about new features being introduced?
All new developments in Elten are listed in the changelogs, available in the "Help" menu, "Changelog".

## How do I browse the file lists?
File lists are available in the form of a tree. Folders are expanded and collapsed using the left-right arrows.
Note: Do not use the enter key to open folders.

## How do I use the settings windows?
Most places for settings, including program, group, blog or account settings use the same layout, where the window is divided into categories (settings sections) and specific options.
In these windows, the first element is a list of categories. Selecting a category will change the contents of the window, specific items are available by pressing the tab.

# Accounts
## Where can I change my user data?
All profile data can be changed using the option available in the menu, "Community", "Manage my account".
There you can change both the data visible to the public (age, place of residence, name, visitingcard), as well as your account password, enable two-step verification or view your logins.

## What are premium features, what do they offer and how much do they cost?
Information on the current prices and content of each premium package can be obtained from the menu, "Community", "Premium packages".

## Can I change my user name?
Unfortunately we do not provide for this option.

## What is two-step authentication and why is it useful?
Two-step authentication is a way to protect your account even if someone learns your password. The first time someone logs in from a new device, a special code will be sent to the mobile phone number associated with the account, which must be entered to complete the login. In this way, a person without access to your mobile phone will not log in to your account.
Two-step authentication can be enabled in the menu section, "Community", "Manage my account", under "Security", "Two-step authentication settings".

## How do I view my account activity information?
In the menu section, "Community", "Manage my account", under "Security", "Recent logins", you can find a list of recent logins, including date and IP address. If you see anything suspicious here, change your account password immediately. Also remember to check whether any new automatic login keys have been created. You will do this by using the "Auto login keys" section in the same tab.

## How does automatic login work?
When automatic login is activated, a special key will be created to access your account. This key will then be stored on the computer from which the login is made.
In addition, it can be protected by a pin code.
You can view and delete keys in the menu section, "Community", "Manage my account", under "Security", "Auto login keys".

## How do I change my password?
The password can be changed in the menu section, "Community", "Manage my account", under "Security", "Change password".

## What is the difference between a pin code and a password?
A password is an essential element when logging into your account.
The pin code is associated with a particular auto login key - it is the key used to encrypt it.
The pin code only applies to one key and the computer on which that key was created.

# Forum
## What is the idea behind groups?
Groups are communities in which forums are created. In practice, the entire EltenLink portal forum can be divided into groups, which in turn can be divided into forums, threads and thread posts.
Each group can have its own rules and has its own administrator and moderators. A user can be subscribed to any number of groups.
Another difference is the method of joining. Groups can be public, so that any user can read the content created on them and contribute to discussions. There are also hidden or moderated groups, where users can only join with the permission of the moderators.

## How do I create and manage a group?
Groups are created from the "New group" option, available from the context menu in the list of groups. It can be opened via the menu, "Community", "Forum".
All group management options are available in the context menu of the specific group.
New forums are created by entering the group and selecting "New forum" from the context menu. Only the administrator can add and delete forums in a group.

## What is a recommended group?
Recommended groups are special groups that are selected by the council of elders. They can be found in the "Recommended Groups" section, and by default threads are searched in them. They are always open and public groups.
Detailed guidelines for these groups can be found in the EltenLink Rules.

## How can I set up my own language group?
There can only be one language group, i.e. the primary recommended group in a given language. If such a group already exists, it is not possible to set up another one.
If a language community has not yet been officially established and there is a language group with many active members, please contact the Elder Council.

## What are forum tags?
Tags were created to help filter a thread. They can be defined by the group administrator, or they can be created from the bottom up.
Administrator-defined tags are available for selection in the topic creation window.
Freely defining tags requires the tag (one word) to be enclosed in square brackets, for example "[trivia]".
Tags created in this way can be easily filtered, simply use the Shift shortcut in the relevant forum and the up or down arrow to select a tag. Only the topics containing it will be displayed.

# Conferences
## What is space in conferences?
Space in conferences works analogously to an actual room. Imagine a large room. Moving around in it, we can divide the participants in the conversation into smaller groups and then move freely between these groups.
This is how conferences work. By moving through the space, we can change our position in relation to other users. It's easy to imagine three independent conversations going on simultaneously on one channel, and the participants can easily move between them.

## What is the HRTF?
HRTF (head-related transfer function) is a method to virtualise real space. In HRTF channels, when you put on headphones, you can actually hear the relative positions of the users, taking into account whether the person is in front or behind you.

## What is a roundtable?
A channel in roundtable mode has no space. All users in it are automatically positioned as if they were sitting at the same table.
As a result, each user is heard from a slightly different direction, but at the same volume. HRTF is used in this mode.

## Why is Elten asking me to download the HRTF library?
Phonon, the HRTF effects library used by Elten, is relatively large. Including it with each version of Elten would significantly increase the size when downloading both Elten itself and subsequent updates. We have therefore decided to supply it separately, so that its installation is only required once.

## What are whispers and how to use them?
A whisper is a message that is only heard by one selected person. It can be used to communicate confidential information or minor arrangements without changing the channel or using private messages.
To whisper to a user, simply press and hold the space bar on the appropriate person in the conference list. Releasing the space bar is the same as stopping the whispering.

## What is the "Press and Speak" function?
The "Press and Speak" function allows us to make the sound from our microphone only broadcast when we press the selected key sequence.

## What is the difference between conferences and voice calls?
Technically nothing apart from the way they are initiated.
When you call another user, they will receive a notification with the option to answer the call. If he or she chooses to do so, a special private conference channel will be created and the callers will be connected to it.

# Messages
## How does Elten mail work?
Elten mail is a simple mailbox that allows you to send and receive emails using Elten.
Each user is created an email address in the domain "elten.me", for example the user "smith" will receive the address "smith@elten.me".
When a message is sent to this address, it will be delivered as a private message. Similarly, sending a private message to an email address will result in it being broadcast from that account.

## What are group conversations?
Group conversations are special conversations in which any number of users can participate. They behave like any other messages.
Group conversations can be created from the context menu.

## How do I block a particular user?
If you do not wish a particular user to send you messages, you can add them to a blacklist.
You can do this from the menu, "Community", "Manage my account", category "Privacy", "Blacklist".

# Blogs
## How do Elten blogs work?
Elten blogs are based on the popular CMS system WordPress. It is possible to view and manage them from both the client and the website.
The Elten instance of WordPress has been enhanced with several additional functionalities for the program, including following other users' blogs or additional privacy settings.

## How can I manage my blog settings?
Managing blog settings from within Elten requires selecting the appropriate option from the context menu in the blog list.
It is worth remembering that the WordPress admin panel offers many more options for blog customisation.

## How do I log into the WordPress admin panel of my blog?
The first step is to set a password. For security reasons, we recommend using a different password for the WordPress dashboard than for logging into Elten.
In the list of blogs, select your blog and choose "Blog options" from the context menu. Then select the "Other" category and open the window available under "My WordPress account".
From here, it is already possible to set a password via the "Set new password for your WordPress account" button.
Once the password has been changed, you can log into the panel.
From the "Other" tab visited previously, simply select "Open the WordPress admin panel in my browser" for this purpose.

## Can my blog be observed by users who do not have Elten?
Yes, as long as the posts have no other privacy settings. All they need to do is access the blog from their browser.
In the blog's context menu, there is an option "Copy blog URL". This will copy the blog address to the clipboard. Using this, you can visit the blog from any web browser.
Similarly, you can copy links to specific posts.

## How do I change the web address of my blog?
In the list of blogs, select your blog and choose "Blog options" from the context menu. Then select the "Other" category and open the window available under the "Manage blog domain" button.

## Can I view other blogs written outside Elten from within Elten?
Yes, but only blogs using WordPress, the specific action depends on the settings of the specific blog. But it's always worth a try.
This option is available in the main blogs menu, under "Open external WordPress blog."

## How do I format content on the blog?
Two editors are available from within Elten: an editor with formatting and an HTML editor.
Those familiar with HTML and WordPress tags can confidently use the second option. The first provides basic options such as creating headings or links.
All options are available in the context menu.
However, it should be borne in mind that these are the most basic tools. The full range of possibilities will be provided by using the WordPress editor on the website.

# Polls
## How do I answer a poll?
Polls currently have three types of question: single choice, multiple choice and text boxes. An indication of the question type is always given next to the question.
Single-choice questions only require an arrow to indicate the answer of your choice.
Multiple-choice questions require you to select the answer you are interested in using the spacebar.
Text boxes allow you to enter text.
Move between questions using the tab key, as in any other form.

## Why can't I answer the poll?
Several reasons are possible.
The poll may have already been completed by you, it may have expired or its settings limit the list of users allowed to respond.

## What are the filters for?
When viewing responses, it is possible to filter them. There are inclusion filters and exclusion filters.
With inclusion filters, you can only view the answers given by those users who have selected the answer you are filtering in a given question.
Exclusion filters work the other way round: they show the answers of those users who did not select the given answer.
Example: one of the questions in the poll is about gender, the available answers are "Female", "Male", "I prefer not to specify". Selecting an on filter on the 'female' answers will only show the answers given by women in the survey, while an off filter on the 'I prefer not to give' answers will only show the answers of those who did not conceal this information.
A number of filters can be combined, for example selecting only responses from people who are female and under the age of 20, depending on the available questions of course.
Filters are available from the context menu in the list of answers.

# Technical
## What language is Elten written in?
Elten is written in the Ruby language. Parts of the program are also written in C++.

## Can I add anything from myself to Elten?
We would be very pleased if you do.
All information is available on the project's GitHub:
[https://github.com/dawidpieper/elten2](https://github.com/dawidpieper/elten2)

## Where can I find the Elten API documentation?
Official documentation does not exist, but it is possible to generate it via rdoc from the code.

## Can I translate Elten into a new language or improve an existing translation?
Yes, we would be delighted! Write to the Council of Elders about such a desire.

## How can I debug problems in Elten?
The most important tool is the log, found in the "Tools" menu, "Log overview", and also in the file "%appdata%\elten\elten.log", where %appdata% stands for the Roaming folder of the application data.
To access this folder, the easiest way is to press the WINDOWS+R key combination, enter the text "%appdata%" in the "Open" field and press enter.
If you do not see a trace of the error despite selecting the "debug" login level, a more specific approach may be required. Feel free to contact us, we will look for a solution together.

## Where does Elten save the settings?
All settings are saved in the folder "%appdata%\elten", where %appdata% stands for the Roaming folder of the application data.
To access this folder, the easiest way is to press the WINDOWS+R key combination, enter the text "%appdata%" in the "Open" field and press enter.

# Solutions to common problems
## The "Invisible interface" does not work.
Most likely the problem is related to the keyboard shortcut used. It may be that it is already used in another program.
The keys used by the "Invisible interface" can be changed from the "Tools" menu, "Program settings", "Invisible interface" category, "Modifiers" option.

## Automatic login does not work for me.
This problem can sometimes occur after a program update.
Deleting the file "%appdata%\elten\login.dat", where %appdata% stands for the Roaming folder of the application data, may help to solve it.
To get to this folder, the easiest way is to press WINDOWS+R, enter the text "%appdata%" in the "Open" field and press enter.
It is also possible that automatic logging is simply disabled from the "Tools" menu, "Program settings", "General" category, "Enable automatic logging" option.

## I cannot be heard in conferences.
This problem can be attributed to several causes.
From the "Tools" menu, "Program settings", "Sound devices" category, "Microphone" option, check that the correct device is selected.
Elten may have a problem automatically detecting the default device, try deliberately pointing to the correct one. If possible, it is worth testing several different microphones.
If the problem persists, perhaps the microphone is set to too low a sensitivity in the system or the software itself.
During a call, select the "More options" button, "Change volume". Make sure that the "microphone volume" is appropriately high, 100% corresponding to the level in the system.
It is also worth checking in the same "More options" menu that "microphone mute" is switched off and that "Press and speak" is not switched on by mistake.
If none of the following steps help, check the log for errors.
If chat messages are also not arriving or the connection is dropped after a short time, the problem may relate to the firewall in use. Make sure Elten is authorised to connect to the network, including UDP connections. The port used for conferencing is 8133.

## When the computer goes to sleep or the headphones are connected/disconnected, Elten loses sound.
Some sound card drivers cannot handle these events correctly, instead duplicating their instances.
The solution may be to force the use of the default card instead of the explicit selection used in the 'Tools' menu, 'Program Settings', 'Audio Devices' category, 'Output Device' option.

## I cannot change the playback tempo.
It is likely that FX effects have been disabled. You can enable them in the "Tools" menu, "Program settings", "Advanced" category, "Enable FX effects" option.
