# Privacy Policy of the EltenLink portal
This document provides a detailed description of the data collected by the EltenLink portal and how it is used by the administration.
Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact the administration directly through the portal or by e-mail
support@elten.link

## The data collected are:
### Log files and security backups
As part of the scope of maintenance of services related to the EltenLink portal, server event logs and security backups are collected.
The event logs allow us to reproduce errors and problems related to the operation of the services, to protect EltenLink against hacking attacks and similar incidents. They do not contain any private data, in particular passwords or content posted on Elten, but only basic information about the operation of the services (protocols used, web browser or client version, IP address, ID of the service they refer to).
Security backups are used in case of server failure. They contain a detailed record of the database allowing the portal to be restored in the event of a failure. All backup copies placed outside the portal server, especially in external cloud services, are encrypted.
### User data
The only private information required by the EltenLink portal is an e-mail address. No personal information (such as name) is required for registration.
Users within the EltenLink portal can complete their profile by providing data such as:
* first and last name
* gender
* date of birth
* place of residence
However, these profiles are filled out voluntarily and are not collected during the registration process. Users can hide the profile from people outside of their contact list, and delete this information at any time.
As an additional layer of security, users can activate two-factor authentication, which uses the mobile phone number in the process of logging into the portal, sending the verification code by SMS message on the first such attempt from a new device. This is an optional functionality. The phone numbers collected in this way are not used for any purpose unrelated to two-factor authentication.
In the above process, the mobile number data is transmitted via the Simple Notification Service to Amazon.
### Other
Other data collected by EltenLink includes only that provided by users within the platform. EltenLink does not collect any statistics from third parties.
### Cookies Policy
The EltenLink portal does not use cookies with the exception of the automatic login service.

The so-called Newsletter, i.e. information on news, warnings and other administrative notifications relating to the operation of the EltenLink website, may be sent to the e-mail address used during registration.
### By other parties
EltenLink does not pass on the data it collects to any other entities.
It does not use third-party analytical tools or advertising services.
## Data not processed by the administration
