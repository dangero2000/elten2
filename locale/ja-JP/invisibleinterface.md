# Invisible Interface: or the most important feature of Elten 2.4.2!

## What is the "invisible interface"?

The name of this phenomenon is perhaps not entirely apt, and certainly in the case of Elten, after all its interface is always invisible! But let's leave that aside and get to the point. The invisible interface allows you to use the most important features of Elten, ie. whiteboard, messages, or to manage the current conference from anywhere in the program, but, most importantly, also when its window is minimized.
This is made possible by the concept that is Elten "modifier". If you use any Screen Reading program (you certainly do), you have more than once, more than twice, used the INSERT key combined with other keys to perform some of its functions.
Elten behaves similarly in this matter, although its modifier is slightly different (WIN+CTRL+ALT by default). Don't worry about the multitude of keys, as these three are right next to each other on most keyboards, so pressing them is not difficult. Additionally, there is an option to change the modifier from within the settings.
Note: If the default key combination is already used by another program, Elten will automatically try to find another free combination. The currently used combination can be found in the footer of this document.

## Why do I need to do this! I have an Elten window, I know an Elten window, I love an Elten window!

Sometimes there are situations when you are doing something extremely important on your computer and suddenly you get a message, the one and only message, the one you have been waiting for since 5:54 am the day before. In the old version you would have to go to Elten window, open message screen, conversation, read the message, reply and go back to work.
Now all you have to do is press a few keys to do this. You don't even have to minimize the application you are currently using!

## So what are these shortcuts?

A complete list of the shortcuts that work in Elten invisible interface can be found in the "Help" menu. Below are the most important ones. In the list below, the abbreviation MOD stands for Elten modifier.
- MOD+UP/DOWN ARROWS: goes to next or previous item on a list.
- MOD+LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS: Changes the current tab of the invisible interface.
- MOD+SPACE: Repeats the last spoken invisible interface item.
- MOD+R: Responds to the currently selected message or feed post.
- MOD+M: Opens a window for creating a new message.
- MOD+F: Opens a window for creating a new feed post.
- MOD+ENTER: Activates the currently selected option.
- MOD+BACKSPACE: Mutes speech if you are using the SAPI output on Elten, as well as the audio stream.

## Invisible interface settings

There is a new "Invisible Interface" tab in the Elten settings from now on. It will be described below.

- Modifier: Allows you to change the modifier (the first three keys required for the invisible interface to work).
- Tabs to show: Allows you to choose which tabs you want to see and which you don't.

For example, if you never use feed, you can safely uncheck this tab.

## The invisible interface doesn't work! What to do!

If the Elten invisible interface refuses to work on your hardware, it is likely that the modifier selected by Elten is no longer available. Try changing the modifier in the settings. Perhaps the selected combination is already used by a screen reader or other applications?
If you have further problems, feel free to post questions in the forum.
