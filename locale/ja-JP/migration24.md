Dear users! After more than a year of testing, we are giving you the final release of Elten 2.4, the biggest update to the program since version 2.0.
Due to many changes and innovations, in this document we will try to highlight the most important differences between version 2.4 and previous 2.3.8. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the forum, where testers and other users will be happy to try to resolve all doubts.
Please note that not all changes are listed here, but only those we found most significant or interesting.

# General changes
## Change of portal name and addresses
From January 24, 2021, the portal name "Elten Network" has been replaced by "EltenLink" The client, at least for now, remains under the name Elten.
The addresses have also been changed:
* The main project website at
https://elten.link
currently contains information about the nature of the Portal, but more content will be made available over time. The old site is at its current address, but will be gradually phased out in favour of the new one.
* All blogs on Elten have been moved to the address
elten.blog
so if your blog was previously at
xyz.eltenblog.net
from now on its site will be
xyz.elten.blog
* Individual e-mail accounts have been moved to the address
login@elten.me
Until the end of 2021 emails sent to the old address will still be forwarded to the new one. This is the time to communicate the change of address to interested senders.
## New project logo
The EltenLink project logo now shows a laptop on a blue background. On the screen is presented a yellow guide crossed by the tip of a white cane. At the edge is the word Elten(*)Link separated by a 6-pointed star.
## NVDA addon
If you use an NVDA screen reader, you will be pleased to know that from now on you can install an addon that will make working with Elten easier by allowing you to use braille displays or scroll text as you read. If NVDA is installed on your computer, Elten automatically should ask if you wish to install the addon; you will be guided through all the installation steps, which are very similar to installing a typical NVDA addon. Whenever there is an update to it, Elten will inform you about it at startup.
## Context Menu
From now on, all local functions specific to a section are available in the context menu.
To open it, you can press the context menu key on your computer or Alt - this will be the first menu tile on the left. If you don't want the context menu to show in the menu bar under alt, go to Tools/Program Settings/Interface and uncheck Display context menu in menu bar.
Another way to access the context menu, useful if your computer doesn't have a predefined key, is to use the Quick Action shortcut, SHIFT+F10 by default.
## New dialog and menu layout
From now on, the layout of dialog boxes and context menus corresponds to that known from operating systems. All confirmation dialogs and context menus should be navigated with the up/down arrows.
## Premium Features
Elten Ling, like any service, requires not only the time needed to develop it, but also the money needed to pay for the servers.
Therefore, since version 2.4, so-called premium features have been introduced to make the program more enjoyable to use and at the same time to allow for its further development.
The proceeds from their purchase go only to the maintenance of the server; as of version 2.4, the developer derives no material benefit from the development of the project.
You can read more about package prices and how to get them in your language group's Elten development forum and in the Premium section under Community/Manage my account.
## Audio representation of lists and menus
From now on, each item in a list or menu will have a slightly different audio representation depending on where it is located (more at the beginning or the end) - items at the beginning are heard on the left, and items at the end are heard on the right.
To change this setting, go into Tools/Program Settings/Interface and deselect the Use stereo positioning for user interface checkbox with a space.
ATTENTION!
Positioning does not apply to speech synthesis, only to the sound theme.
## Content only in known languages
Elten will no longer display groups, polls or forums in unknown languages if you select the ones you speak.
To do this, go to Community/Manage My Account/Languages and select all the ones you know.
If you still want to see, for example, in the list of groups, those in unfamiliar languages, select the appropriate option from the context menu for the given section.

# Quick Actions
Until now, Elten's main window remained empty and you had to use menu to access any of the functions; now this space has been taken up by the Quick Actions. These are shortcuts similar to those you may find on your desktop - links to programs, notes, links, etc. In Elten, such a shortcut can be created for virtually any function, including groups, forums, blogs, conversations, specific functions (such as conferences), settings, etc. To get to the desired location, you simply need to click Enter on the action or use the shortcut assigned to it (more on this below).
## Adding Quick Actions
Most items in the program now have a context menu, which allows you to access local functions specific to that item or window. It also allows you to add an item to Quick Actions.
So, for example, if you want to add a favourite blog to this list, position yourself over it in the list of blogs, open the context menu and click Add to Quick Actions and the item will land at the bottom of the list in the main window.
Another way to add an item, mainly options from the main menu that are impossible to add from the context menu, is to click Ctrl+N in the main window of the program or open the context menu and select the appropriate option. In both cases, you will find yourself in a window, which will allow you to select the action you are interested in from a list of available actions and add it.
Let's imagine that we want to create a shortcut to the notes. This option is available from the main menu, so you can not open the context menu on it. That's why in the main window, in the list of actions, we click the context menu, click Add and select the Notes we want from the list, confirming with the Enter key.
## Changing the keyboard shortcut
In the context menu of the quick Action, or by the shortcut Ctrl+K, we can change the keyboard shortcut for each action. This is a global shortcut, which will work in the whole program. For example, if you want to quickly access a conference while browsing the forum, just press the shortcut of your choice.
NOTE!
The list of shortcuts is limited to function keys (F1-F12) and their combination with the Shift key (Shift+F1-F12).
ATTENTION!
Opening a context menu can also be a Quick Action! :)
ATTENTION!
The current form of the program assumes the absence of any global shortcuts for functions that had them before, e.g. saying the date, time, last spoken message, pausing/resuming media, etc.
The only way to keep such a shortcut is to add the appropriate action in the main window, set the appropriate shortcut and hide the action.
Note that some of the default Quick Actions are hidden.
## Hiding Fast Actions
To keep the list of Quick Actions in the main window short, you can hide some of them. This is especially useful for actions like saying an hour, which are usually only called by a shortcut. Note that some of the predefined Quick Actions are hidden by default.
Let's imagine that we want the F8 key to tell the time, as it used to.
We add an action to the main window via the context menu or the Ctrl+N key.
The action is now at the bottom of the list. For now, it can only be called by pressing Enter.
Set a keyboard shortcut for the action by selecting the appropriate option from the context menu or by clicking Ctrl+K and selecting F8 from the list of available shortcuts.
Now we can call the action not only with Enter in the main window, but also with a shortcut in the whole program.
If necessary, we can hide the action in the context menu.
From now on, it will not be visible in the main window, but the shortcut will still work.
To display all hidden actions, click Show Hidden Actions in the context menu. To hide them again, click Hide Hidden Actions.

# Messages and conversations
## Editing a group conversation
If you don't like the name of a conversation you belong to or want to manage its members, just open the context menu on it after setting yourself in the conversation list and click Edit Group Conversation or press ctrl+e. The window you will land in allows you to rename the conversation and add people.
## Muting a conversation
If you temporarily want to suspend notifications from a conversation as you can do in popular instant messengers, position yourself on it with the arrow in the conversation list and select Mute this Conversation from the context menu. The window you will be in allows you to pause notifications for a quarter of an hour, an hour, a day, a week, or forever, that is, until you turn it back on.

# Blogs
From May 2020, Elten uses the WordPress system as its blogging engine. This allows for blogs that are easily customisable and aesthetically pleasing to external visitors.
Each blog has its own unique address in the elten.blog domain. From the blog's context menu, the address can be previewed.
Depending on the configuration, external visitors can view blog posts and/or post comments on the blog.
## Blog Settings
From now on, you will find all the options for your blog in one place. You will access them from the context menu when you position yourself on the managed blog in any blog list.
You'll select a settings category with the arrow, and reach a specific setting with the Tab key.
Attention!
Here it is also possible to change the Internet address of the blog (premium feature).
## Generating a password for your WordPress account
From the Other Settings tab of any blog, you can go to My WordPress account. This is where you can set a password that will allow you to log in through a page where you can configure settings that are not accessible from within the program, including enabling plugins or switching between themes.
## Following a blog post
A blog post can be followed, just like a forum thread. You'll receive notifications of every new comment on it. To do this, position yourself on it in the list of posts and select the appropriate option from the context menu or press Ctrl+L. This can also be done inside the post.
NOTE!
Premium feature, available in the Courier package.

# Forum
Most of the changes to the forum include new moderation tools. These allow you to manage the group more effectively, but the information on them will also be useful for users. Key new features include:
* Closed forums - users cannot create new content in these forums, that is, in a closed forum you cannot add new threads. It should be noted here that you can add posts in open threads in a closed forum. Closed forums are marked with an appropriate sound.
They can be used, for example, to add announcements, archive forums and threads and create forums where new threads can be created only by the moderation of a given group.
* Tags - sets of values defined by moderation.
This is used to organise a forum if it is large or diverse. For example, instead of creating a separate forum in the Polish Elten Community for 18 plus content, they will be tagged with a specific tag. This way, the name of each such thread will be unified and there will be no need to isolate them. You can move between tags in the forum using the SHIFT key and the up/down arrows.
* Offering threads - moving threads in groups 
This function is used to conveniently share threads in groups. You no longer need to temporarily delegate permissions or create additional groups. Just select Offer this thread to another group or press ctrl+o and select a group from the list.
* Locking a post - a locked forum post cannot be edited.
* Report a post - if a post violates the rules of a group, you can report it to its moderation using the Report this post function located in the context menu.
Apart from that, a few more non-moderation related new features have been made available:
* Received mentions (premium feature) - this is a separate section in the forum, where we will review the received mentions. They are sorted from newest to oldest. When we focus on a particular mention, we can enter the thread with the right arrow and use the ctrl+slash shortcut to view its content in the edit field (function available in the basic version). We can also press ctrl+shift+slash to reply to a mention (premium feature). Such a reply will be sent to the sender as a properly formatted private message.
* Forum tree sorting - in the context menu in the Forum section, we can choose how groups and forums should be sorted.
* More extensive search engine - From now on, we can specify whether we want to find something in the title, the content, or the title and content of the thread. There are also several criteria available relating to the groups being searched.
* Marked threads (premium feature) - These work similarly to followed threads, they appear in the list of forums but do not show up in What's New. Their use may depend on the user. For example, they can be used to mark threads to read later, threads that you particularly like, threads that contain relevant content, etc.
* Bookmarks in threads (premium feature) - they are saved on the server and allow you to quickly jump to the saved posts. They can be viewed from the context menu/navigation, bookmarks or using the shortcut CTRL+B.
* Mixed forums - these are forums where each entry can be either voice or text, at the author's discretion.
* Likes - a function known from many popular forums and discussion groups, from now on from the context menu and using ctrl+k shortcut you can like a post you are on. When the post is liked by at least one person, the information about the number of likes will be displayed between the post content and the user's signature. You can also check who liked a post from the context menu or by using the ctrl+shift+k shortcut.
* Group Rules - if the group has rules, each user can read them from the group menu, and in addition, he must accept them when joining, also when joining automatically by posting a thread or post in an open group.
* Message of the day - it is possible to set a message of the day in the group, which after each edit will be displayed to users who want to browse the group. This does not apply to viewing threads from the group through the search engine or what's new.
Minor changes can also be highlighted here:
* The Shift+Enter key combination or the corresponding option in the context menu displays all the threads in a group by the date of the last entry.
* When moving an entry, the threads are sorted by group.
* When closing a non-empty thread creation window and a thread with a non-empty reply, a prompt to confirm the abandonment of the entry is displayed.
* There is an appropriate annotation under edited posts.
* From the context menu, it is possible to display the original content of a post
* While editing posts, it is possible to add and remove attachments

# Polls
Since version 2.4 it is possible to interpret the results of polls in more detail. The old look of the responses can be obtained by selecting Show Report, while the new, Show Results features the ability to view responses to a specific question as well as the ability to filter responses. Thanks to this you can e.g. check what was marked in question 2 by people who had marked "Yes" in question 1 or who haven't marked "No".
You can also create hidden polls and share them in groups or in private messages (Courier premium package).

# Settings
To access the program settings, open the menu with the Alt key and select the Tools section.
The Elten settings window has been rebuilt so that it now more closely resembles the windows of many other programs, such as NVDA. When you enter it, you will find yourself in a list of categories; select one by hovering the arrow over it, and navigate through the settings belonging to it with the Tab key.
## Announcement of types of controls
If you want to be informed about a type of control (button, list, etc.) in a specific way (by sound, voice or voice and sound), go to Tools/Settings/Interface and press the Tab key until you get to the field Announcement of types of controls, which allows you to select the option you want. You can make Elten inform you about the type of control by sound only (a different sound for a button, a different sound for a list, etc., without any voice information), by voice only (no sound information), and by both voice and sound.
NOTE: Remember that sounds for other events will still be played unless otherwise selected in the sound theme settings.
Remember to save your settings before you exit the window.

# Help
## Changelog
From version 2.4 the changelog is available for translators to adapt to all languages supported by the program.
## Program Version
The Program Version window has been rebuilt to convey information about both Elten's compilation number and the libraries used.
## Sound guide
Elten is now able to explain to you what the different sounds of your sound theme mean; just go to Help/Sound Theme Guide and you will find yourself in a list that contains all the sounds with explanations. To play a particular sound, press the space bar; to stop it playing, press the Tab key twice to reach the Stop button.
NOTE!
Elten also allows you to edit the sound theme, i.e. to customize the sounds according to your preferences; to do this, go to Tools/Sound Themes, position yourself on the downloaded theme you are interested in, and select Edit from the context menu.

# Tools
## Install/reinstall the program
From now on it is possible to install or reinstall Elten from the Tools menu.
* If you are using the stable version, this option allows you to reinstall the program in case of detected errors.
* If Elten was started from a portable version, it is possible to install it on your system from this menu.
You can either install the version currently running or download the latest version available from the server.
## Log viewer
This is a useful feature when you want to troubleshoot a program or test something; to see the logs, go to Tools/Log viewer. You will find yourself in a window, which allows you to choose the type of event and specify its parameters. In the list below you will find the events found. If you are not an advanced user, navigate the window with caution and do not hastily use the information you get from it.

# Conferences
Since version 2.4, Elten also allows you to make voice calls. Conferences, as this feature is called, allow you to create channels in which conversations can be held.
These are fully encrypted so that no outsider can overhear them.
## Channels
Channels in conferences can be of two types:
* Group, created by the group administrator and visible only to members of that group,
* Private, created by users and visible to all other users.
If you want to ensure the privacy of your conversations, you can set a channel password that the person joining the channel must enter.
After selecting Conferences from the menu, a list of available channels will appear. To join one of them, press the Enter key on it or select Join from the context menu. If you want to create your own channel, select Create channel or press CTRL+N shortcut.
## Surround sound
It is possible to create channels with surround sound (HRTF). In these channels, users can move around in space, emulating a natural conversation. You can use this feature to plan a podcast or conference call, for example.
The applications of this capability are almost limitless and depend only on the imagination of the users. For example, you can step aside to discuss an issue without disturbing others, or divide a conference into several independent groups/stands that operate independently but allow you to move between them easily.
To create a channel with surround sound support, simply select the appropriate option in the channel creation window.
## Objects in Channels
Objects in channels are background elements that can add ambience or provide reference points for users. There are a number of predefined objects that can be placed in the space, and users with the Audiophile package can also add any sounds of their own.
## Moving through a channel space
You move around a channel space using the arrow keys when the cursor is on a control labeled Channel Space.
You can also Go to user other users directly. To do this, select the Approach option from the context menu or press CTRL+G in the list of users, after selecting the desired person.
## Push to talk function
If you do not want to be heard all the time, you can activate the Push to talk function. This is a key or several keys that, when held down, make you heard in a conference and when released will automatically mute your microphone.
Push to talk also works when the Elten window is minimised.

# Other
## Spell Check
To check the spelling in any text field before you send/approve/save it, simply press Ctrl+Shift+S or select the appropriate option from the context menu; a list of errors found will be displayed with the option to correct them.
NOTE!
Premium feature, available in the Scribe package.
## Generating alternative login codes
If you have two-step verification enabled, every time you want to log in to a new device, you will be asked for a code, sent in an SMS message.
However, there may be times when you are temporarily unable to access your phone.
The alternative codes generated in the section Community/Manage My Account/Account Security/Manage Two-Factor Authentication/Generate backup Codes will be useful in such circumstances.
Once selected, you will see a text box with the codes that you can copy and save in a safe place in case you need to use them.
## Calling a user
If the user is online, you can call him. He can either answer or reject the call. If he answers, a special conversation space is created for you, similar to a channel in conferences, but no one but you can join it.
Under Community/Manage my account/Privacy you can set who can call you.
## New window - Administration and Authors
Once you are in Community/Users/Administration and Authors you can see Elten's development staff by function - translators, programmers, administrators, moderators, sponsors etc.
## Manage My Account
The account settings window, located in the Community menu, has been rebuilt - now the settings are divided into categories, just like the program settings. In this section you can edit your profile, change your status and signature, write your visitingcard, manage known languages, account privacy and security, personalise What's New notifications and manage premium packages.
## Media
In version 2.4, the player field and media such as audio posts on blogs and voice posts on forums has been unified so that it looks similar everywhere, making it easier to navigate.
## Playback speed and tempo
When in the player, press shift+up/down arrows or ctrl+up/down arrows to adjust the playback speed and tempo.
## Do Not Disturb Mode
If you're busy and don't want to be distracted by notifications, turn on Do Not Disturb mode, similar to what you're familiar with from IOS and Android. When it's active, you'll only see notifications in the What's New section, but sounds and voice information will not be presented. By default, this feature can be invoked with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+F2. Once enabled, it will remain active until you manually turn it off or close the program.

# Where are these functions?
## Avatars
Due to copyright issues and the low popularity of this feature, as of version 2.4 avatars have been removed from the program. This means that avatars will not be visible in the user's business cards and you will not be able to set them up or listen to them.
Their role has been partly taken over by audio blog posts.
## Chat
The Chat function is no longer in the Community menu. Due to its low popularity in its previous form, this feature has been removed, but moved to Voice Conferencing, where you can text within a channel.
## Files
From now on, you can view your files in a separate program that you launch from within Elten. You can download it in the Programs section.
All the features you remember from previous versions have been retained or improved.
## Playlist
The function to create and play playlists is no longer available in the main Elten program. To use playlists, download a program for this in the Programs section.
NOTE!
Shortcuts to play playlists are available as Quick Actions.
## Youtube
From now on Youtube is a separate program that we run within Elten. We can download and install it in the Programs section. Its look and functionality have been slightly revamped to make it easier to navigate and play videos. One of the many new features is the ability to download videos under your own name and in different formats.
